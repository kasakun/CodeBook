# Binary Number with Alternating Bits

Given a positive integer, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if two adjacent bits will always have different values.

Example 1:

```bash
Input: 5
Output: True
Explanation:
The binary representation of 5 is: 101
```

Example 2:

```bash
Input: 7
Output: False
Explanation:
The binary representation of 7 is: 111.
```

Example 3:

```bash
Input: 11
Output: False
Explanation:
The binary representation of 11 is: 1011.
```

Example 4:

```bash
Input: 10
Output: True
Explanation:
