# React-Antd-Demo

## Install

Use create react app to create your react project.

```bash
npx create-react-app $your_app_name
cd $your_app_name
```

Add ant design and react-router

```bash
npm add antd
npm install react-router --save
```

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

## Structure

All you need to focus so far is in `src`.

The entry file is `App.js`, you can define the routing here. Keep in mind that
create-react-app is a one page web, the header and footer can be template.

You can put all your other components in one customized directory, like in this
demo, we call it `contents`. Each component has a `.js` file and `.css` file to
describe itself.
