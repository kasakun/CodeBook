# Multiply Strings

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Example 1:

```bash
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```

Example 2:

```bash
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```
